## Usage

First, download and install the
[Docker Toolbox](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-toolbox).

To build the container from scratch, run `make`, or skip this step to use a
pre-built container from the
[Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/lynxtp/openjdk-jdk).

To run the
[javac command-line tool](http://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/tools/unix/javac.html),
run `./javac`. The javac command will have access to the current working
directory and all subdirectories.
